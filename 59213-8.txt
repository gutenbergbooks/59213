"Where's Shadow? Here, Sir. Shadow!"--_Shakspeare._

"The notion that has seized Mr. Bennett's fancy is an odd one, and he
has worked it out with great humour. A comic figure makes a shadow
really more comic than itself, and it excites an amount of agreeable
curiosity and gratification on seeing the one figure, to imagine
how the artist will contrive to make it reflect another."--_Morning
Chronicle._

Humorous Illustrations by Charles H. BENNETT, author of "Shadows." Demy

"This will be a popular book. Mr. Bennett's first venture, the
grotesquely-treated "Shadows," was a decided hit, and he seems to have
the knack of combining comicality and fancy in such proportions as
shall be appetizing and digestible for the public."--_Spectator._

of the reader, and retaining it in fixed and eager attention till a
crisis of some kind is reached. Take our word for it, boy friends, if

THE NATIONAL MAGAZINE.

A Journal devoted to Literature and Art, and equally an organ of
both--an Art Magazine, but not one to which Literature is merely
incidental; a Literary Magazine, but not one to which Art is a mere
adjunct.

Attractiveness of subject and of treatment is studied in every
department. Tales by acknowledged authors occupy considerable space;
reviews; essays; varieties of travel and adventure; humorous sketches;
and occasional reports of public matters, find due place; thus forming,
altogether, whether regarded from a literary or an artistic point of
view, a Magazine of surpassing interest and beauty. Four Volumes,
handsomely bound, price 7s. 6d. each, have been already published.

Vol. V., just published, handsome cloth gilt, 7s. 6d. Cases for
binding, 1s. 6d. each.

THE BOOK AND ITS MISSIONS;

Dedicated to the British and Foreign Bible Society, and to the friends
of Bible Circulation throughout the world. Edited by L. N. R., author
of the "Book and its Story." The plan of this cheap periodical, which
has obtained a wide circulation, is distinct from that of any other,
and it aims at a character less ephemeral. THE BOOK OF GOD itself
is shown to map out the whole world into five divisions by its own
reception in it.--Past and Present. It may be traced to the ANCIENT
CHURCH, which primarily received it--to the lands where the PRIESTS NOW
HIDE IT FROM THE PEOPLE--to those where a FALSE BOOK has supplanted
it--to those where it is YET UNKNOWN--and finally to the PROTESTANT
countries, from whence it goes forth to be the Light of the Earth. This
progress is illuminated in THE BOOK AND ITS MISSIONS by historical and
geographical details, carefully collected from the best authorities,
in order to interest the general reader, and to afford, especially
to the young, a more realising sense of the mighty work the Bible is
accomplishing "afar off," and "near home." It is very suitable for
circulation in SCHOOLS. While the principles of the Bible Society do
not permit its office bearers to accept the responsibility of editing
such a magazine as the present, it yet enjoys their unqualified
recommendation, and much of the matter passes under their direct
supervision.

Published Monthly, Price 2d. Nos. 1 to 40 are all in print; also in
Vols., cloth, plain, 3s.; or gilt edges, 3s. 6d. Vols. I. II. III. are
now ready.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
